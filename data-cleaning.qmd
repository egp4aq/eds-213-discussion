```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
bottle <- read_csv(here('data','Bottle.csv'),locale=locale(encoding="latin1"))
cast <- read_csv(here('data','Cast.csv'))
```

```{r}
glimpse(bottle)
```

```{r}
glimpse(cast)
```

notes: there are multiple bottles in one cast, that is why cast count for cast df is unique but bottle df is not unique, which is why cast count for bottle df is repetitive. 

We want to join on cst_count

```{r}
cast_bottle <- cast %>% 
  left_join(bottle, join_by(Cst_Cnt, Sta_ID)) %>% 
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date)) %>% 
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))
```
